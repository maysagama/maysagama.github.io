        <h1>Guidelines for complex AAC systems with LLMs</h1>

        <div class="details" style="font-size: 16px;">
          This project focus on creating HCI guidelines for researchers, designers and developers that want
          to explore the use of AI language models to assist individuals with complex communication needs.
          This analytical and critical work was developed between May 2023 and February 2024, in collaboration with the
          <a href="https://www.gprt.ufpe.br/grvm/" target="_blank">Reality and Multimedia Research Group</a> (UFPE, Recife, Brazil) and the
          <a href="https://idrc.ocadu.ca/" target="_blank">Inclusive Design Research Centre</a> (OCAD, Toronto, Canada), as part of my master’s thesis.

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <hr style="width: 100%; color:black; float: left; opacity: 60%; margin-top:-15px;align-items: baseline;" size="1">
       
        <div class="background">
        <p>Some individuals with complex communication needs rely on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices for daily interactions. However,
          AAC users often struggle to communicate during real-time conversations, considering the high amount of physical and mental effort it takes to compose
          their messages. While users can prepare for conversations by adding new words and phrases to their communication devices, pre-programmed messages may not
          always cover everything that is necessary to express a person's intentions during a real-time conversation. To address this issue, researchers are exploring
          the use of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), to improve AAC systems. However, it is crucial to carefully analyze the
          benefits and drawbacks before rushing to create new technological interventions. This study examines the existing contributions and lists opportunities and
          challenges for applying LLMs to AAC software, collaboratively with users. Additionally, the study addresses the usage of Blissymbolics, a language with grammar
          and vocabulary but no phonology, which plays an essential role in assisting individuals with congenital conditions in developing their literacy skills. Two secondary
          research studies were conducted to systematically and critically map the relevant literature on both LLMs and Blissymbolics uses for AAC. The primary research
          followed a co-design approach and engaged AAC users and familiar listeners who shared their expectations, concerns, and ideas about future LLM integration into
          AAC devices. The data collected from the primary and secondary research was used to generate comprehensive human-computer interaction guidelines for developing
          robust AAC systems that use AI language models. Moreover, the opportunities, challenges and risks involved are also discussed. Furthermore, this work applies the
          guidelines proposed and showcases their adaptability by developing and detailing a conceptual AAC system that uses LLMs.

          <p>Rather than hastily developing novel AI interventions, this work aims to take a step back and provide designers,
            developers, and researchers with comprehensive human-computer interaction guidelines and reflections for integrating
            <b>reliable, customizable, and adaptable </b> AI language models into high-tech AAC systems.
            <br><br>
            
          Additionally, this work addressed the use of Blissymbolics which, as a language with no phonology, plays an important
          role in bridging language and communication for children and adults with complex communication needs.

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <hr style="width: 100%; color:black; float: left; opacity: 60%; margin-top:-15px" size="1">

        <div class="method1">
          <p>The research method was divided into three phases. The first phase involved conducting both primary and secondary
          research to establish the foundation of this work. The second phase focused on developing the guidelines, and the
          third phase involved applying them to create the Proof of Concept for this work.</p>

            <img src="../images/llms1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" alt="Research methods structure.">

          <p></p>The <b>secondary research</b> comprised two systematic literature mappings in which similar methods were applied for data collection,
          analysis and synthesis, ensuring consistency.
          <br><br>
          The <b>primary research</b> followed an Inclusive Design approach, using the co-design method, thematic analysis, and qualitative
          synthesis of the findings. Co-designers shared their concerns and expectations, discussed the benefits of the Bliss language and brainstormed
          ideas for future AI and AAC applications.
          <br><br>
          <b>Participants:</b> Four collaborators were recruited, including individuals with communication needs, familiar
            listeners, and an expert in the Blissymbolics language.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 14px; opacity: 80%;margin-top: 10px;">Note: All co-designers with communication needs had cerebral palsy, which affected their verbal speech production.

        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <hr style="width: 100%; color:black; float: left; opacity: 60%; margin-top:-15px" size="1">

        <div class="insights">
          
          <li>LLMs could largely assist AAC by relating and adapting previously stored information to the users’ current environmental conditions and conversation partner.</li>

          <li>Users must be able to trust that the system will not change or have control over their message. Ideally, an AI-based AAC software could provide real-time feedback over the output results. This option could save keystrokes by reducing the need for correcting requests, but might reflect in increased latency and hardware requirements.</li>

          <li>Users could personalize the generated output to fit their needs or preferred communication style by, for example, personalizing different options as tone, voice, emotion, or message type. Another option would be to enhance the generated messages based on the user's prestored information and communication behaviour. </li>

          <li>Providing an easy-to-operate personal vocabulary option can be especially useful for ensuring the privacy of preteen and adolescent AAC users, who might face difficulties when depending on their caregivers or family members to decide how they will communicate  </li>

          <li>Rather than treating all users equally, its essential to respond to the needs of individual users. Are they a novice or expert user? What are their literacy skills? What other personal, cultural, or linguistic particularities are relevant to take into account? Such information could be collected to provide a personalized experience and enable the system to advance with the user.</li>

          <li>During co-design sessions, AAC users described several scenarios where context-awareness could be highly beneficial for them. For instance, they wanted a system that was able to put their ideas in the right context. A co-designer explained that oftentimes, she prepares in advance for a conversation, but it might follow a different path than she predicted, and her pre-programmed texts now seem a bit off the subject.</li>

          <li>Developers must be aware that choosing inappropriate training datasets, either for pre-training or fine-tuning, might reflect in incorrect or even harmful outputs. As the pre-training process normally uses large unlabeled data for unsupervised training, the system will learn and make correlations independently, which reduces human intervention and can pose severe risks for the end users.</li>

          <li>AAC users voiced the importance of AI assisting them in coming up with phrases more quickly. One co-designer mentioned how she wanted to defend herself more quickly in situations where people were rude to her, either by ignoring her or by making fun of her way of communicating.</li>

          <li>As the mother of an AAC user, one of the co-designers expressed concerns about individuals relying too heavily on technology to direct their thought processes or influence their decisions. She proposed that AI integrations in AAC could anticipate the user's sentence without necessarily directing the conversation but rather offering the paths to it. Additionally, this would increase the user's control over the final output and conversation flow.</li>

          <li>Often, AAC users have some form of physical limitation, which might increase the occurrence of typos. Typing error occurrence can be exceptionally high in some input methods, such as eye-gazing. Thus, novel AAC systems must include forms to mitigate this. In the context of AI-based applications, it is essential to include noise data during the model's training phase.</li>

          <li>Since each verbally impaired person develops their own syntax model, their message might lack formal grammatical rules and require further clarification. Including grammatical corrections in the applications could potentially enhance communication and independence by reducing the need for clarification, especially for users with limited literacy skills. However, such correction must not come at the expense of altering the message's meaning.</li>

         <h2>Guidelines</h2>
         <hr style="width: 100%; color:black; float: left; opacity: 60%; margin-top:-15px" size="1">

         <div class="">
          <p>Our HCI guidelines introduce three principles for creating robust AI interventions for high-tech AAC. In other words, all AAC software that targets an LLMs integration must
            be: reliable, customizable and adaptable. By <i><b>reliable</i></b>, we emphasize on offering a system that the user can always trust and rely on. On the other hand, <i><b>customizable</b></i> is related
            to having a system that allows the user to easily modify it to their needs, preferences and unique capabilities. Lastly, <i><b>adaptable</b></i> is associated to a system that adapts itself
            to the user's needs, according to their preferences, environment and situation. All three principles are further divided into seven categories each.

          <p>Based on the previously detailed guidelines, an LLM-based AAC software was conceptualized as the Proof of Concept.
            The next images show the initial sketch of the brainstormed system, which was polished and detailed by
            creating a high-level architecture diagram of the system.

          <p>In the thesis, the Proof of Concept is detailed and its attributes are compared with the proposed
            guidelines. The categories that were fully, partially or not addressed are also accessed and discussed.
            This demonstrated the guidelines’ adaptability to different contexts and the importance of acknowledging
            the points that are not covered.</p>

          <li>Research fatigue is most present in minority groups. This is especially common among
            individuals with disabilities as they are invited to participate in research
            starting from a young age. They are often invited to “test a solution” rather than being part
            of the process and deciding what is better for them.
          </li>

          <li> 
            Involving minority groups in your research might seem challenging due to ethical
            requirements and limitations in recruitment and communication. However, these challenges
            should not stop you from conducting inclusive research and giving agency to those who benefit
            the most. Keep in mind that the researcher's beliefs and conduct will directly reflect in the
            study results.   
          </li>

          <li> 
            Adapt yourself. What can you do to accommodate your research participants better? Don’t be scared to ask questions!
