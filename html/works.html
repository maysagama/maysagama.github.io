            <h2> Guidelines for complex AAC systems with LLMs</h2>
          </a>  
            <p style="margin-top: -10px;">   
              This project proposes Human-Computer Interaction guidelines for researchers, designers and developers that want
              to explore the use of AI language models to assist individuals with complex communication needs. Secondary studies were conducted
              to examines the existing contributions and lists opportunities and challenges. The primary research followed a co-design approach and engaged AAC users and familiar listeners who shared their
              expectations, concerns, and ideas about future LLM integration into AAC devices.              
              This analytical and critical work was developed between May 2023 and February 2024, in collaboration with the
              <a href="https://www.gprt.ufpe.br/grvm/" target="_blank">Reality and Multimedia Research Group</a> (UFPE, Recife, Brazil) and the
              <a href="https://idrc.ocadu.ca/" target="_blank">Inclusive Design Research Centre</a> (OCAD, Toronto, Canada).

            <p style="margin-top:-10px">
              This is a Foundational research I lead at YouX Group between July and November 2022.
              As part of a governmental policy, this project aims at geo-referencing all Brazilian rural
              properties to promote controlling, monitoring, and combating deforestation of native vegetation.
              The system includes more than 7 million registries that cover 672 million hectares of
              national territory. Our mixed-methods approach allowed us to identify and map the particular pain
              points of each of the 27 Brazilian federative units (states) and propose applicable
              solutions to their main issues. The work summarized complex research findings into 
              straightforward deliverables, which were used during multiple governmental meetings and allowed for quick decision-making.
              Our results not only impacted the brazilian green agenda, but also the client, as our collaborative approach      
              strengthened the relationship between the federal government and all state's staff. The final findings were proudly
              presented during the Brazil at the National Conference of the Rural Environmental Registry.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have gained much attention recently, and their applications are widespread in
                different domains, including private and public sectors. While these technologies can be harnessed for beneficial uses,
                they can also display undesired discrimination. The risks of AI bias are particularly concerning as it holds the power to
                perpetuate or amplify existing harms against minoritized groups. This work aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion of
                biased AI, specifically in language models. The study analyzes bias, the risks it poses to persons with disabilities and
                provides suggestions for building more inclusive and equitable AI technologies. Next, a simple experiment tested implicit
                disability bias in language models. The model made biased assumptions when sentences were evaluated in one chat. It often
                associated nouns that were not accompanied by disability-related adjectives with positive situations, while the opposite
                was associated with negative scenarios. Finally, this work concludes by emphasizing the importance of adopting a careful
                and collaborative approach.

                    <h2>Heritage Education autochthonous' experience</h2>
                  </a>
                <p style="margin-top:-10px">
                  <b>TL;DR:</b> Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, embodies a rich history through both its material traces and the collective imagination of its residents. This research explores how locals perceive urban spaces and cultural heritage, focusing on their experiences in the Santo Antônio and São José neighborhoods. Conducted through a remote digital ethnographic study, it examines how digital media can enhance Heritage Education and reshape the experience of walking in the city. A geolocalized system was created, featuring 60 points and 10 routes with media (photos, videos, audios) tied to memories and figures from the Dutch occupation (1630-1654). The findings show that geolocation can foster situated learning and highlights the challenges of designing digital systems in urban contexts marked by violence. Additionally, it suggests that such installations can facilitate narrative exchange and learning outside traditional settings like schools and museums, bringing heritage education into public spaces.
